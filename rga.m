function [R,S]=rga(G)
% RGA   Relative Gain Array
% 
% R=rga(G) returns the Relative Gain Array, R based on the gain matrix, G.
%
% For square matrix, G, R is the normal RGA, defined as follows:
%   R = inv(G') .* G 
% If G is nonsquare, R is the so called General RGA:
%   R = pinv(G') .* G
% 
% The RGA is a very useful tool for control structure design. For a square
% system (the number of inputs equals to the number of output), the RGA can
% be used to find input-output pairs (one input to control one output).
% There are many publications on how to pair input and output using the
% RGA. The basic rule is:
% 1. Avoid input and output pairs which have negative relative gains.
% 2. Avoid input and output pairs which have large relative gains.
% 3. Select input and output pairs which have the relative gain close to 1.
% 
% Interestingly, if the RGA is repeatedly calculated based on R, i.e.
%
% R = rga(R);
% 
% Eventualy, the RGA will converge to a selection (0,1)-matrix. With the
% second output, 
%
% [R,S] = rga(G) produces a selection matrix, S based on the repeated RGA.
%
% where S is (0,1) matrix with the same dimension as G. Each row and each
% column of S have only one element of 1, but all others are 0. The element
% of 1 indicates which input (column) should be used to pair which output
% (row).
% Note: The selection matrix, S, is only a recommendation. It may not
% satisfy the rules stated above and may not be appropriate for some
% systems.
%
% For nonsquare systems, the general RGA can also be used to select inputs
% if the number of inputs is larger than the number of outputs, or to
% choose outputs, if the system has more outputs than inputs. The second
% output in this case gives the input (output) effectiveness, E.
%
% [R,E] = rga(G)
%
% Where E is a column vector corresponding to the input (output). Inputs
% (outputs) with largest input (output) effectiveness are recommented to be
% selected for the control system.
